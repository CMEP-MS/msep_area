# msep_area
Workup on the general MSEP area: characteristics of the Sound itself (e.g. salinity and bathymetric data), watershed climatology (precipitation), and watershed population calculations.

The scripts to combine watershed boundary files were run before other scripts, so that a single combined shapefile could be used in other workflows.  

## Data Sources  

Bathymetry - downloaded from Gulf Data Atlas  

Precip - two sources: monthly climate normals from NCEI; annual climate normals from the PRISM group at Oregon State University.

Salinity - downloaded from Gulf Data Atlas, Dynamic 5-zone salinity. This contained information for several estuaries around the Gulf, and only Mississippi's were copied into this repo and used to make graphics.
